### Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles:
-----------------------------



Unresolved Stretch Goals: <br>
1. Create Levels to the game where as the levels progress:
   a. the number of cards increases.
   b. the timer decreases.
2. Refine the aesthetic of the webpage (+add animation).
3. At the beginning of the game, have a "walk-through" demo instead of instructions.
