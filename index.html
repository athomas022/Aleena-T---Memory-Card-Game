        <h2>There are 12 cards with 6 pairs of identical cards that are shuffled randomly. Click on an individual card to reveal the image hidden underneath. Keep clicking to match the cards with the identical images to win the game. Careful though, you'll only be able to see 2 revealed cards at a time so pay attention and remember those card positions.<br> Simple enough right? Well, you'll only have 5 attempts to match all 6 pairs correctly. Don't fret if you can't match the cards the first time, you can "Play again" but with a new set of shuffled cards. Now, are you up for the challenge?</h2>
